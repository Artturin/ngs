doc Escapes s so it could be used as single argument in bash. The method is slow as it uses external program.
doc %RET - Str
F escape_bash(s:Str) {
	# Not using external printf because on Mac it doesn't have %q
	chr(0) in s throws InvalidArgument("escape_bash doesn't work on strings containing the zero character")
	`echo -n $s | line: bash -c 'IFS= read -d $\'\\0\' s; printf %q "$s"'`
}
